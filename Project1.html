    <h1>Automatic Washroom light switch</h1><hr>
   <h2><ul>Period of project: 3rd Year 2nd Semester</ul></h2> 
    <h3><ul>Status : Completed</ul></h3>
    <h4><P>This project is on design and construction of an automatic bathroom light. The 
        system automatically turns ON bathroom light when the bathroom door is opened, 
        and remains lit in the occupied state. When the door is opened again the lamp turns 
        off after a very short delay. This automatic circuit saves energy and greatly assists 
        your visitors, especially at night. The “single-chip” circuit, built around the popular 
        decade counter CD4017 (IC1), is very compact, and can be powered from any 
        5VDC/500mA mobile phone travel charger/similar smps adaptor. After construction, 
        try to enclose the whole circuit in a suitable plastic case for total convenience. Next, 
        arrange the door switch (S1) such that when the door is closed it should be in closed 
        state</P></h4>
